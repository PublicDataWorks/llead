            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, the Colonel Esports League defeated Ball State University’s Esports league in a 3-0 match. Yet, almost no one heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Colonel Esports league, founded in 2020, is just one of about 175 esports leagues in the country. With five teams and an administrative department, the Colonel Esports League currently stands at 52 members with over 400 people in the Colonel Esports discord server. This league is already rising to fame, with students transferring from other universities and incoming freshmen choosing Nicholls to participate in the league.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonel Esports even has their own space on campus. Currently residing where Wild Blue used to be, the league has been able to create great energy in the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From RGB light strips to quality seating, this space is perfect for anyone, even non-gamers, to come relax in between classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jorge Galicia, a senior Computer Information Systems major from Golden Meadow, felt that a gaming league on campus would cater to a large demographic of people that was never catered to before. There were rumors going around for a while about a gaming league, but Galicia was the first to step forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to make an impact wherever I go,” Galicia said. “When my daughter comes to Nicholls, I want her to look [at this league] and say, ‘Wow, my dad did that.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important goal of the Colonel Esports League is to maintain a safe space for everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Layton, the faculty advisor for the Colonel Esports League, strives to represent diversity and inclusion for all gamers involved, from competitive gamers to casual gamers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layton, a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, knows how difficult it is to find a safe space to fit in. She has been gaming since she was a child, and like Galicia, wanted to create this league for gamers to feel included. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to break the stereotypes of gaming,” Layton said. “I see Colonel Esports as a program that will foster a gaming ecosystem in the south where individuals from all walks of life can participate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Colonel Esports League is striving to be one of the largest esports leagues in the United States. They have been in contact with game developers that want to do lectures in the esports space, including the gaming development company in New Orleans. They also want to get more students involved by having Uno tournaments and other activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The video game ecosystem is coming to Louisiana, it’s just a matter of jumping on the ground and getting involved,” Layton said. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a year, on the last night of what many like to call “Spooky Season,” it has been tradition for Americans to dress up in costumes and go trick or treating. The entire holiday of Halloween has been modernized overtime, and the costumes are no exception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some costume classics will always be relevant, most reflect the generations and the time period surrounding the present Oct. 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween costumes have always depicted people’s fears and favorite characters, the most popular figures in the media and so much more. These costumes are key in learning what things defined a certain time in history. As you could imagine, Halloween costumes have certainly changed a bit over the years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Halloween costumes were made to genuinely disguise someone, deeming them completely unrecognizable. They were also actually meant to be spooky, as the “trick” in trick or treat was once more emphasized, and young people would go around scaring others with their costumes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Halloween costumes began being mass-produced by commercial companies, most were homemade with paper masks and bedsheets. Though they had little flexibility, many trick-or-treaters grew creative and this allowed for people to dress as ghosts, witches, pumpkins and black cats; essentially everything we tend to associate with the holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the playful fun also came the not-so-harmless “jokes.” Many costumes that were worn back then would not be acceptable in today’s society, and for good reason. Many white people would wander around appropriating turbans and wearing blackface, presenting all sorts of racist conflicts that are altogether insensitive. Children would also deem feathers and dress as Native Americans. These contrarian costumes are thankfully not as popular today in a society that is more likely to take offense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the years passed, Halloween costumes became less problematic and more about entertaining the children. Many began dressing as characters from popular radio shows like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Around the 1950s, companies began to mass-produce costumes. This gave many children the chance to dress up like princesses, cowboys, clowns and popular characters like Batman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1970s, costumes grew more adult themed. Political masks, like Nixon after Watergate, were often worn for Halloween and have remained popular since. To this day, it is not uncommon to find someone sporting a frightening mask of their Congressman of choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1980s, costumes began surrounding everything new in pop culture, including horror movies and Star Wars. The streets were filled with big-haired gruesome killers as well as Darth Vader, C-3PO and Princess Leia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the 1990s and the early 2000s rolled around, in pure “Mean Girls” fashion, the emergence of “sexy” costumes began. You could put a sexy spin on anything, from a nurse to a vegetable. The list surprisingly goes on and on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also beginning in the 1990s, it was popular for costumes to reflect current events, no matter how controversial. Even after the O.J. Simpson trial, there were masks and gloves packaged up into a Halloween costume on the shelf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything is fair game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, Halloween is all about going to parties and haunted houses, getting candy, and dressing up. Friends coordinate group costumes based on popular tv shows and movies, couples dress up together, even pets wear Halloween costumes now. Today’s costumes span the themes of all Halloween&#8217;s past. The classic sheet ghost has even made a recent resurgence thanks to TikTok trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From ghosts and witches to princesses and presidents, you never really know what you will see on the street today. Except for Harley Quinn, you will always find somebody dressed as Harley Quinn!</span></p>
