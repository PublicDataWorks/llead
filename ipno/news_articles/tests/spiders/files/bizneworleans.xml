<p class="x_MsoNormal">&ldquo;Operation HOME&rdquo; was launched last month to provide immediate financial assistance to the LCMC family to help in recovery and rebuilding from the storm. To date, more than 6,600 of LCMC Health&rsquo;s 12,000 employees have received assistance through this initial launch with a value currently reaching $3.2 million.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">LCMC Health has launched a $3 million fund to provide additional financial support for employees who sustained catastrophic losses from the storm. LCMC Health provided a $2.5 million investment in this fund and look to receive some $500,000 from outside businesses and individuals to support the effort.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Administered and managed by the Greater New Orleans Foundation (GNOF), this fund will provide team members up to $5,000 for help in recovery and rebuilding from the storm due to devastating damage. An application process has been developed for LCMC Health team members to apply for the fund.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">&ldquo;Our LCMC Health family remains fully focused on recovery efforts across our hospitals and facilities, while they themselves are working on their personal recovery at home,&rdquo; said LCMC Health CEO Greg Feirn. &ldquo;The expansion of our Operation HOME relief fund is integral as our amazing, one-of-a-kind team continues to recover and rebuild from the impacts of Hurricane Ida.&rdquo;</p>

Civil asset forfeiture is the ability for the government to seize people&rsquo;s personal property without charging or convicting the property owner of a crime.</p>
<p>The report showed that from 2000 to 2020, the government seized a yearly average of almost $9 million&nbsp;in assets &mdash;&nbsp;totaling over $186 million over two decades. Additionally, the report found there is little transparency surrounding the process of civil asset forfeiture. Specifically, there is no way to tell if there was a conviction in conjunction with the seizure of personal property.</p>
<p>The report shows that the property that is seized is disbursed between law enforcement agencies. Sixty percent goes to the seizing law enforcement agency, twenty percent goes to district attorney&rsquo;s offices involved in the forfeiture, and another twenty percent goes to the criminal court fund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government is supposed to protect life, liberty, and property, not threaten it. Since courts, district attorneys, and law enforcement get a portion of what is seized, an incentive has been created that encourages more of this seizure of private property,&rdquo; said Raheem Williams, Director of the Kevin Kane Center for Opportunity Policy.</p>
<p>The Pelican Institute laid out a list of policy suggestions that could bring Louisiana more in line with other states that have addressed civil asset forfeiture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate civil asset forfeiture in favor of&nbsp;criminal asset forfeiture and require a conviction for the accused party before their property can be seized.</li>
<li>Set a minimum value for property eligible to be seized.</li>
<li>Put all forfeiture related funds into a neutral account such as the state general fund.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Civil asset forfeiture is an affront to the core values of a free society. We cannot allow innocent people&rsquo;s possessions to be taken by the government any longer. Louisianans deserve fairness in their legal system, not the threat of their personal belongings being seized even if they are found innocent,&rdquo; said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute for Public Policy.</p>
