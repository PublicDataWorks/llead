            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the first time I noticed the Outdoor Home Store in Slidell, right there at 1290 Fremaux Avenue, as you head into town.<br />
It looked interesting enough that I stopped by and quickly found something quite unique inside—some of the coolest outdoor BBQ grills, plus the most beautiful—and durable—outdoor patio furniture I had ever seen. (I now own some turquoise colored outdoor chairs and table that has a guarantee of lasting 20 years—the wife and I absolutely love it.)<br />
Owner Eric Delaughter decided to open the store and sell items for outside your house since he has a construction company that does landscape and patio construction for residential and commercial locations in the area. He is a lifelong Slidellian who built the construction business, then realized Slidell didn’t have a true outdoors store—until now.<br />
After getting to know him and seeing the store begin to establish itself, he told me that when COVID was fading enough he planned to have outdoor cooking demonstrations with his Green Egg and other popular BBQ grills.<br />
And this Saturday, Oct. 23 at the store the public is invited to stop by when Food Network Star Erica Blair will be on hand for a cooking demo and tasting. They will host the special appearance by Blair from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.<br />
Eric said that Erica will be offering free tasting for some fantastic BBQ dishes and other items she plans to cook for the public, and I am certain this is something you should make time to stop by for. First off, you will get to taste some incredible food, and secondly, you will be impressed with the cool stuff he has in the store.<br />
There will be some special items offered for the purchase of $5 raffle tickets, and I promise you will be impressed with some of the most awesome BBQ grills and accessories, plus outdoor patio furniture, that will be on display during the cooking demonstration. And Eric already made it clear to me months ago that his pricing can stand with any of the big box stores.<br />
Once again, as I’ve said many times, go check out a true local businessman and his store. It will be plenty of fun, and tasty as well.</p>

<p>An update on our mayor….talked to Greg Cromer on Tuesday to see how he is doing after the still surprising news we all heard over a week ago that he had unexpected heart surgery that included four bypasses.<br />
For those of you who may have missed the story in The Slidell Independent last week, Greg was “the picture of health,” as I heard so many people say, however, he apparently wasn’t quite as healthy as he thought. Thanks to urging to get a stress test from his friend Dr. Kumar Amaraneni, who had a life-threatening heart attack several years ago, the mayor went in for the test and was quickly told he was having heart surgery later that evening.<br />
That’s something that will certainly get your attention.<br />
Greg was like so many of us who didn’t imagine he had such a serious situation brewing inside his body. He really did look quite healthy to us all, and that’s why Slidell was so shocked to hear a week ago on Monday that he was recovering after the surgery.<br />
But the good news this week is everything looks great as far as the recovery, and even though he is not ready to show up for work too soon, he is making steady improvement every day. The biggest problem he said is that his body tells him he needs to rest, but his head doesn’t always agree.<br />
“I feel like I’m OK to be working, but Peggy (his wife) and the doctors have made it clear I have to take this easy,” he said.<br />
I guess so! Our beloved mayor underwent surgery about as serious as it gets, so it will be a while before he starts making the rounds again. But for now, I am here to report all is well and I do believe Greg will eventually feel like he has a second lease on life—not just from the mental standpoint of knowing he has taken care of a potentially serious problem, but knowing that physically he practically has a new heart.<br />
Keep listening to the docs and rehab folks Greg. We’re all praying for your complete recovery as soon as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As opposition to a proposed $350 million casino continues to mount with every passing week, the reasons for the lack of public support appear more obvious each day.<br />
The latest voice emerged against the proposed casino by Peninsula Pacific Entertainment (P2E) when it was posted on Facebook last week by longtime City Councilman Bill Borchert, one of the most respected members of the City Council. Borchert simply laid out some pure facts in the offer by the California company.<br />
It was months ago when P2E and St. Tammany Corporation announced the Community Agreement that spelled out “all” the money the parish and city would get if residents voted to let the company build the casino next to the Oak Harbor exit in Slidell.<br />
St. Tammany Corp CEO Chris Masingill applauded the deal as “the best community agreement ever in the state of Louisiana.” Yet, months later as the numbers got crunched by Borchert and Mayor Greg Cromer, it’s hard to see why this deal is so good. For that matter, it could be downright devastating for Slidell.<br />
In the Community Agreement the casino company said they will give 5 percent of their annual net gaming revenue to the parish, to be split in a pie between a couple dozen agencies and governments. Initially the company said they expected to do $180 million in annual gross revenue, but for some reason they have since reduced that to no more than $100 million. If that proves to be true, Slidell will net somewhere between $500,000 to $600,000 from the Community Agreement.<br />
While that sounds like a fair amount of money, Cromer and Borchert both said their studies show a nearby community to a casino could lose 15 percent of its sales tax revenue or more since the casino would take a lot of business from restaurants and bars, as well as customers from various other local businesses.<br />
Slidell is currently near $25 million a year in sales tax revenue, so depending on the loss of business to the casino—and there certainly would be a substantial amount since they plan five or more restaurants—the city could lose “$2 million to $6 million a year in sales tax revenue,” predicted Borchert.<br />
The “best community agreement ever” certainly doesn’t look so good for Slidell, but apparently the number crunchers for P2E didn’t figure that.<br />
It mirrors the way, from the beginning, the public was completely left out of any consideration of a casino for St. Tammany. The deal was concocted behind closed doors nearly two years ago by a handful of public officials, then presented to the public—certain everyone would fall in love with it.<br />
Had the casino proposal been made public from day one, had public hearings been held to see what residents in St. Tammany wanted (or not), had numbers been discussed to see what would REALLY have been a great deal for citizens here, then there just might be more support for the P2E project.<br />
Even though the public still gets to vote on Dec. 11, it’s becoming downright shocking to see what little consideration there was to the public for the idea of a casino in Slidell, or St. Tammany.<br />
And that is now becoming a huge problem for those who were so sure it was a great idea.</p>
