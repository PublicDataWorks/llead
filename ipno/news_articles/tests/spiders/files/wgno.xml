<p>NEW ORLEANS (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://WGNO.COM" target="_blank">WGNO</a>) — After some terrible outcomes with Hurricane Ida, the New Orleans Council passed new regulations for senior facilities.</p>



<p>Ordinance 33,452 and Resolution R-21-388 were approved by the council on Thursday. The legislation reportedly <a href="https://wgno.com/news/local/emergency-protocols-for-independent-senior-living-facilities-in-new-orleans/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wgno.com/news/local/emergency-protocols-for-independent-senior-living-facilities-in-new-orleans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extends many emergency protocols</a> of senior living facilities — a topic that became a <a href="https://wgno.com/hurricane-ida/senior-living-facilities-could-face-new-guidelines-following-hurricane-ida/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wgno.com/hurricane-ida/senior-living-facilities-could-face-new-guidelines-following-hurricane-ida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">central issue in New Orleans</a> after five tenants died following Hurricane Ida. </p>



<p>After the storm, five senior tenants died, more than <a href="https://wgno.com/news/idas-fury-left-a-complex-power-challenge-in-louisiana/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wgno.com/news/idas-fury-left-a-complex-power-challenge-in-louisiana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">600 residents were evacuated</a> by the city health department, and nine facilities were closed — including six owned by the <a href="https://wgno.com/hurricane-ida/heartbreaking-investigation-into-senior-living-deaths-in-new-orleans-continues/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wgno.com/hurricane-ida/heartbreaking-investigation-into-senior-living-deaths-in-new-orleans-continues/">Archdiocese of New Orleans</a>. Across the state, even facilities had their <a href="https://wgno.com/news/louisiana/ldh-revoking-licenses-of-7-nursing-homes-after-deaths-of-evacuated-residents/">licenses revoked by the Louisiana Department of Health</a>. </p>



<p>According to a statement issued by Councilwoman Kristin Gisleson&nbsp;Palmer, who sponsored the policy, the law extends many of the city's nursing home emergency protocols to independent and residential living facilities. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Immediately after Hurricane Ida, I saw firsthand the negligence of our City's most vulnerable - seniors and those with disabilities - when checking in on all the senior centers and independent living apartments in my district<strong>," Palmer said in the announcement. </strong>"Many of the tenants were physically or financially unable to evacuate, and the owners and operators of the properties left them in inhumane conditions to fend for themselves. I'd like to thank my fellow councilmembers and the City's Health Department for their collaboration on this legislation that helps establish a clear line of communication ahead of the next disaster and ensure this never happens again."</p></blockquote>



<p>According to the policies, living centers with six or more facilities focused on caring for seniors or people with disabilities to:</p>



<ul><li>Have a point of contact who must always remain on-site (24/7) during declared emergencies</li><li>Provide daily updates to the Mayor’s Office of Homeland Security once an emergency order has been activated, and immediate updates in case of evacuation</li><li>Submit emergency operations and evacuation plans to Safety and Permits and to all tenants</li><li>Renew their city licenses annually</li></ul>



<p>City health director Jennifer Avegno says the new regulations are about increasing cooperation — not about placing blame.</p>



<p>These procedures also apply to care centers with at least half of their units dedicated to permanent supportive housing. The law goes into effect on November 20, just 10 days before the end of hurricane season. </p>

<p>NEW ORLEANS (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://WGNO.COM" target="_blank">WGNO</a>) — Days after a second arrest for drinking and driving, New Orleans City Councilman Jared Brossett says he is not stepping down, but he is stepping away from is duties as a council member to seek treatment for alcoholism.</p>



<p>In a statement, Brossett writes "addiction is an illness. It is not a choice. For me, my family, and those I serve, I must prioritize rehabilitation. </p>



<p>Early Monday morning, police arrested Brossett for his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wgno.com/news/crime/new-orleans-city-councilman-jared-brossett-arrested-for-drunk-driving-again/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wgno.com/news/crime/new-orleans-city-councilman-jared-brossett-arrested-for-drunk-driving-again/" target="_blank">second DWI</a>.</p>



<p>In June of 2020, he crashed a city-leased SUV on Elysian Fields near the I-10 off-ramp, then failed a sobriety test. Brossett agreed to <a href="https://wgno.com/news/local/nola-councilman-jared-brossett-to-pay-over-45000-in-restitution-for-2020-car-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay more than $45,000 in restitution</a> to the city and entered a rehab program at Ochsner.</p>



<p>Brossett said this week he will enter an in-patient rehabilitation center.</p>



<p>The councilman added he will complete his term on the council. His staff will do his job until he returns.</p>



<p>Brossett is also a candidate for Council Member-At-Large in the November 13 election, but he said he will suspend all campaign activities. </p>
