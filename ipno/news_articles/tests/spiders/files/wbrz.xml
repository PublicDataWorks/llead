                &lt;p&gt;The New Orleans Saints survived a wet, sloppy West Coast swing to defeat the Seattle Seahawks
                13-10 for Monday Night football to improve to 4-2 on the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saints offensive
                gameplan was highly focused on running back Alvin Kamara who figured into 30 of the Saints 66 plays as
                the tailback accounted for 179 of the team's 304 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamara scored the only Saints
                touchdown of the night as he hauled in a 13 yard touchdown toss in the second quarter to give his team a
                10-7 lead at halftime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saints defense rallied in the second half forcing the
                Seahawks into three field goal tries, of which only one was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rookie Saints
                kicked knocked down a 33 yard field goal try with two minutes remaining to give the team the game
                winning lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamara became the fastest NFL player to reach 3,000 career rushing yards
                and 3,000 career receiving yards with his big performance against Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saints
                will now host the Tampa Bay Bucs on Halloween evening in the Superdome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

                hspace="8"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BATON ROUGE - Stacks of manila file folders cover Jane
                Wood's office. Each folder represents a victim of a violent crime. In her seven years as Crime Victims
                Coordinator for the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office, Wood says her workload this year is
                incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just nonstop," Wood said. "There were three homicides this weekend.
                Sometimes there are four or five shootings a night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood's work begins shortly after
                a violent crime happens, getting in touch with the surviving victims, or in the case of homicide
                victims, their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For homicides, we give [families] a day because they're in
                such shock," Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood says the vast majority of victims she interacts with are
                the most vulnerable, lacking access to resources. It's those desperately needed resources her office can
                provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Wood's most often used tools is the Crime Victims' Reparations
                Program, which can give innocent victims, or their families, funds to cover or reimburse funeral and
                burial costs, medical bills, and lost wages, among other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trickle-down
                effect [of] what one murder does to a family, or to this community, is just incredible," Wood said.&lt;br
                /&gt;Last year, 262 cases were awarded funds through the Crime Victims' Reparations Program, totaling
                $874,926.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Wood says 165 cases have received reparations, totaling
                hundreds of thousands of dollars. She expects the total number of cases and dollar amount awarded this
                year to surpass 2020 totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a weekend that saw several homicides, Wood has more
                manilla folders on her desk. Some of the families she must now reach out to do not even know the program
                and other resources exist for victims. Others will reach out to her office first, desperately in need of
                help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Offenders] don't think about the parents," Wood said. "They don't think about
                the little brother or sister. They don't think about anything else, what it does to this family. Their
                lives are forever, forever changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on Crime Victim Services or
