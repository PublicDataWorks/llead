<p><span data-contrast="none">One of the most recent instances came last week as United Way of St. Charles and Ochsner Health partnered to host a supply distribution event at the campus, with more than 500 cars lining up to receive six pallets filled with supplies to help with recovery from Ida. The event also featured a mobile care unit provided by Ochsner that provided COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-157290 size-large" src="https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3-1024x810.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="810" srcset="https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3-1024x810.jpg 1024w, https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3-300x237.jpg 300w, https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3-768x608.jpg 768w, https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3-600x475.jpg 600w, https://www.heraldguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UW-Drive-3.jpg 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Among the supplies distributed were cleaning supplies, water, paper towels, batteries, hygiene kits, diapers, wipes and disposable masks. Those supplies came via donations by Ochsner Health, St. Charles Parish Hospital, Zachry Group, Valero Energy and Shell. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">$5,000 worth of chicken sandwiches were also provided to visitors for lunch, courtesy of Southerns Food and Mullin.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Twenty Ochsner volunteers were on hand to distribute the goods to community residents. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“At a time when our own United Way Team is ‘playing hurt’ and has been impacted by Ida, I am proud that United Way staff and all of our wonderful volunteers could come together and organize and deliver these distribution events,” said John Dias, Executive Director of United Way of St. Charles. “It’s truly neighbors that have been impacted helping neighbors that have been impacted.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Several different groups and/or organizations have been utilizing the site as a base, including Catholic Charities – whose offices were severely damaged in Ida – and RPCC staff. Two volunteer groups have also been living there. A free legal aid office has been established as well for those seeking advice in regards to things like insurance/storm damage claims. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“They came up big because it gave us a central place where, if any group around the country wanted to donate supplies, we could direct them there,” said Dias. “Instead of asking a group to deliver here on this day or there on that day, we were able to tell people, yes, we are able to accept your donations at 13145 Highway 90 in Boutte right away. It gave us a central place toward many difference purposes.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

<p>Festival admission for a full day is $8 per adult or teen, $5 for children ages 6 to 12 and free for children 5 and under. A house tour will be available for an additional $8 per adult and teen and free for children 12 and under.</p>
<p>Craft vendors throughout the United States will be on hand to showcase their talent and sell their handcrafted items. Destrehan Plantation Executive Director Tracy Smith said the plantation’s mule barn promises to captivate antique collectors with distinctive pieces from antique dealers throughout Louisiana.</p>
<p>“This is the plantation’s biggest fundraiser each year,” Smith said of the fall festival. “I think the community is excited for it, especially after our community having to endure the pandemic and then a category 4 hurricane … we need a break. This will be something fun. I feel like there’s going to a lot of excitement this year.”</p>
<p>Smith said cleanup and recovery at the plantation started the day after Hurricane Ida. While the home’s grounds received a lot of tree and debris damage, Smith said the main structures were unaffected.</p>
<p>“I went out there and said, ‘My goal is to have this place cleaned up and ready for the festival,’” Smith said. “After the first few days of clean up I knew we were well on our way.”</p>
<p>Smith said all proceeds from the fall festival will go to the restoration and preservation of Destrehan Plantation and its dependency buildings, and that this year’s festival will feature more vendors than ever and the return of alcohol sales.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy we’re able to have it,” Smith said, adding the festival weekend marks the plantation’s first large-scale public event since Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>No masks will be required outdoors at the event, Smith said, and the requirement for indoor mask wearing will be solely dependent on whether or not the state is under a mask mandate at the time of the festival.</p>
<p>Cochon de lait po-boys, shrimp and grits, shrimp po-boys, onion mums, BBQ sandwiches, andouille nachos and alligator on a stick are just a handful of the food options that will be available for purchase at the festival. Children’s activities will include pony rides, hand waxing, interactive games and arts and crafts, and there will be craft artisans demonstrating trades and domestic duties utilized in the early 1800’s as well.</p>
<p>Local band Les Bons-Riens will open the festival’s live entertainment on Nov. 13 from 10 a.m. to noon. They will be followed be Ryan Foret and Foret Tradition, which will perform from 12:30 to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Kayla Woodson and Faith Becnel are scheduled to perform on Nov. 14. Becnel will take the stage from 10:30 a.m. to noon, followed by Woodson from 12:30 to 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Parking on the plantation’s property is free, and additional parking will be available on the levee and nearby Bridge Park. Destrehan Plantation is located at 13034 River Road in Destrehan.</p>
<p>Smith said the addition of extra vendor spots this year means there are a handful of spots still available. Any vendors interested in participating in the festival should send an email to <a href="mailto:melissa@destrehanplantation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">melissa@destrehanplantation.org</a>.</p>
